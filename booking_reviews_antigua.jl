Service was VERY friendly and very helpful, at the desk and in the dining room.  Rooms were very clean (we asked them to only change the linens every other day, as is our custom in most rooms) but we had them dump the trash, bring in fresh water bottle, etc.  daily.  Location is quite good, about 5 blocks from the Central Square and 3 blocks from the big church.  Close to lots of restaurants.  We walked to everything in town for 14 days and only took a tuk-tuk or taxi or guide's car to go somewhere outside of town.

You can hear every noise from everywhere (coughing, talking, showering, flushing toilets, creaking beds, absolutely every noise goes through the walls.  Plus, the other couple accompanying us got a room on the first floor, which is across from the kitchen, and next to the dining room.  It smelled of mold/mildew, had no fan, no window (the window opens onto the dining room, so you couldn't ever open the shades or window) and there is a lot of noise that comes from the kitchen from breakfast making activities from 7am to 10am. It had a king bed, which was actually a negative, since it left NO walking room around the bed in the room.  The room would have worked much better with a Queen bed in it, space-wise. If you get a room on the 2nd floor, you're in pretty good shape, but if they are full and you get a room on the first floor, I think another hotel at this price point might be better.  Everywhere in Antigua you must deal with the noise almost every night from barking dogs outside and often howling in-heat cats, so ear plugs in most any hotel are nearly a must.

{"title": "A Magical Easter Weekend Stay", "positive_content": "This was our second stay at Hotel Casa Santo Domingo, the first having been during spring break two years ago. In January I stumbled upon a great airfare to Guatemala City for the Easter long weekend, and I was surprised to see that there were still a few rooms available at Casa Santo Domingo, as I have read that \u201cSemana Santa\u201d is the busiest time of year in Antigua.\nThis time we booked a Spa Living room, because we used the spa facilities (for an additional charge) every day during our previous stay. So having access to the spa included (as well as a discount on food and drinks ordered there), made it very appealing to us. Because it was Easter weekend, the rates were almost double what we had paid two years ago, but given the uniqueness and quality of the Casa Santo Domingo experience, we didn\u2019t care.\nI arranged for the hotel to send a driver to pick us up at the airport close to midnight, just like last time. Some Tripadvisor members warned me that it would be very difficult to get into Antigua on Holy Thursday night due to the streets being closed for the processions, but when I contacted the hotel with this concern, they assured me there would be no problem, and there wasn\u2019t. The transfer took only 35 minutes.\nWe checked in quickly and were led through the darkened, hauntingly beautiful property to our room on the second floor of the spa wing. It was well appointed and in excellent repair. We had to call down to the front desk for more hangers (just like last time), but otherwise it had everything we needed. After unpacking, we took a very short nap before heading out at 4AM to see the preparations for the processions. Expecting guests to be up early, the hotel had a staff member serving coffee and pastries at a table near the main entrance\u2014such a thoughtful touch!

I turned myself and clapped my hands while saying: well done, you guys are doing a really good job! They reaction were like: no, she had another night booked for today.

After my stay and time to reflect on my experience, overall I'd say expectations were not met:\r1) While the overall aesthetic was well done, the lack of noise isolation from other rooms and the outside made the stay in the room and sleep at night uncomfortable. We were placed in one of the first/ground floor rooms. Any movement and conversation held by our neighbors directly above us was heard quite vividly, almost amplified given the construction of the house.\r2) The shower drain was clogged and therefore did not drain properly. It appeared to have been clogged for sometime as I felt a layer of film/residue that coated the shower floor. The shower itself worked fine, but this made for an unpleasant shower.\r3) Price for this house/hotel was high given my experience and also when compared to other places available in the area.\r4) The following was a small, but impactful experience during my stay. I had made the reservation at Casa Girasol for three nights. The morning after the second night, one of the staff members was trying to inform my guest and I that we were to check-out that morning. I called another staff member to sort the issue out. They informed me that I was not checking-out, but I needed to move rooms as another guest (arriving that night) had requested the room I was placed in. It was eventually decided that I'd stay in the existing room, but the fact that the staff would even request that of my guest and I seemed rather unprofessional. I believe it is the property manager's responsibility to prevent those conflicts from occurring, and not my responsibility to accommodate another guest, let alone a guest who had not even arrived at the property.", "score": "6.7", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Couple", "Deluxe Room", "Stayed 3 nights"]}

Fine I guess; I suppose I'm just particular in that I like to have someone around in case I need anything during my stay.\rRoom - My room was the first one on the ground floor. The way the hotel is built, all other guests have to walk past this room's window, so I tended to keep the curtains closed for privacy. The other window looks out into a small outdoor utility space (= nothing to see), directly across from which is the kitchen window - so again, I tended to keep the blind closed. Unfortunate, as it's nice to have some natural light / a view.\rThere is no soundproofing between the floors, so my wooden ceiling was the floor of the room above. You can hear every footstep, movement and conversation quite clearly. I can't say for certain, but I imagine the rooms on the second floor might offer a better experience in this regard, especially if you're a light sleeper like me.\rThe morning I went up to take advantage of the rooftop patio, another guest had done their laundry and draped it over all the chairs, table and railing to dry, so it was a bit awkward moving someone's delicates out of the way so that I could have a seat!", "score": "8.3", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Solo traveler", "Deluxe Room", "Stayed 1 night"]}

The guests in this room need to be able to access the window downstairs to be able to open it. Secondly the Casa is clearly set up on more of an AirBnB, full house rental basis, which would work well. They're not set up for the comings and goings of a normal guest house though. It was quite an ordeal just to get someone to come so I could pay them which was time-consuming and frustrating both for me and probably the owner.

After my stay and time to reflect on my experience, overall I'd say expectations were not met:\r1) While the overall aesthetic was well done, the lack of noise isolation from other rooms and the outside made the stay in the room and sleep at night uncomfortable. We were placed in one of the first/ground floor rooms. Any movement and conversation held by our neighbors directly above us was heard quite vividly, almost amplified given the construction of the house.\r2) The shower drain was clogged and therefore did not drain properly. It appeared to have been clogged for sometime as I felt a layer of film/residue that coated the shower floor. The shower itself worked fine, but this made for an unpleasant shower.\r3) Price for this house/hotel was high given my experience and also when compared to other places available in the area.\r4) The following was a small, but impactful experience during my stay. I had made the reservation at Casa Girasol for three nights. The morning after the second night, one of the staff members was trying to inform my guest and I that we were to check-out that morning. I called another staff member to sort the issue out. They informed me that I was not checking-out, but I needed to move rooms as another guest (arriving that night) had requested the room I was placed in. It was eventually decided that I'd stay in the existing room, but the fact that the staff would even request that of my guest and I seemed rather unprofessional. I believe it is the property manager's responsibility to prevent those conflicts from occurring, and not my responsibility to accommodate another guest, let alone a guest who had not even arrived at the property.", "score": "6.7", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Couple", "Deluxe Room", "Stayed 3 nights"]}

Fine I guess; I suppose I'm just particular in that I like to have someone around in case I need anything during my stay.\rRoom - My room was the first one on the ground floor. The way the hotel is built, all other guests have to walk past this room's window, so I tended to keep the curtains closed for privacy. The other window looks out into a small outdoor utility space (= nothing to see), directly across from which is the kitchen window - so again, I tended to keep the blind closed. Unfortunate, as it's nice to have some natural light / a view.\rThere is no soundproofing between the floors, so my wooden ceiling was the floor of the room above. You can hear every footstep, movement and conversation quite clearly. I can't say for certain, but I imagine the rooms on the second floor might offer a better experience in this regard, especially if you're a light sleeper like me.\rThe morning I went up to take advantage of the rooftop patio, another guest had done their laundry and draped it over all the chairs, table and railing to dry, so it was a bit awkward moving someone's delicates out of the way so that I could have a seat!", "score": "8.3", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Solo traveler", "Deluxe Room", "Stayed 1 night"]}

{"title": "Windowless room in an otherwise lovely Casa", "negative_content": "The Casa itself was lovely in terms of the shared spaces but my room was probably the poorest of the 4. It was a strange layout with a internal balcony overlooking a store room. The only window to the room was in that store room below which was locked so I couldn't open it to get some air in (as there was no fan either). The bathroom had a glass block style window as did the closet both of which weren't openable. There was no curtain on the store room window either so it was impossible to have a fully dark room which I prefer. The guests in this room need to be able to access the window downstairs to be able to open it. Secondly the Casa is clearly set up on more of an AirBnB, full house rental basis, which would work well. They're not set up for the comings and goings of a normal guest house though. It was quite an ordeal just to get someone to come so I could pay them which was time-consuming and frustrating both for me and probably the owner. Definitely book it if you're there for more than 1 night and not having to leave early and specifically request not to have the room with the odd internal balcony.", "score": "6.3", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Solo traveler", "Deluxe Room", "Stayed 1 night"]}

In Antigua, this is quite a distance, as it's a really challenging city to get your bearings in. It's mostly a grid but very few streets are actually labeled/signed.\rThe breakfast was adequate at best. Not sure if the menu changed, but it's certainly nothing to look forward to. The free airport pick-up (a promotion mentioned on TripAdvisor) turned out not to be free, and when my flight time changed by 2 hours (which I communicated the day before arriving), I was left to get a cab at the airport. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid and the free shuttle promotion was the reason I booked this place. Really lame.\rCandelaria also seems to cater to loud groups of teenage tour groups, which got old.\rOn top of all this, I opted to stay in Antigua for an extra day due to some medical stuff that came up. Switching hotels was too big of a pain, so I extended by a day and moved from the Special Room to the Standard Room, unable to justify $87/night for a pretty basic room. Bad move.

The female receptionist did end up making the breakfast, and she was lovely and nice.  I have been traveling and living in mostly hostels for 3 years, and this was the worst experience I have ever had in a hostel.  I am not a fussy traveler, If you show me what I am really getting, I am generally pretty happy. Don't put that you speak english when the receptionist doesn't, receptionist should be polite and friendly even in difficult situations, toilet paper is (in my opinion) the bare minimum of hospitality.

When you enter, you pass a nicely decorated hallway to the back of the house, where the rooms of the older part of the hotel are located (and where the manager\u2019s family lives). From there, through an inconspicuous door, you reach a wonderful patio and the newer part of the hotel. We stayed in the suite of \u201cLos Encuentros\u201d over Christmas and New Year for a total of 15 nights. This suite is basically a two-room penthouse on top of the otherwise single-storied hotel, and can be reached via two (quite narrow) spiral staircases. The suite has direct access from the bedroom to the rooftop terrace (which can also be used by other guests), with a view that is likely the best you can have in Antigua. You overlook a green garden with avocado and banana trees, hummingbirds and butterflies, and just in front of you there is the 3500m inactive volcano Agua. To your right you have a great view to the two volcanoes Fuego and Acatenango, the first of which shows its activity by small eruptions every quarter or so (especially impressive at nighttime!). The hotel is perfectly located in the center of Antigua, and you can easily reach all interesting points by foot within a few minutes. Just outside of the hotel there are small shops, travel agencies, bars and restaurants (especially recommended: \u201cFernando\u2019s Kaffee\u201d). Do\u00f1a Irma, who is the manager and heart of the hotel is a warm and caring person (and the rest of her family, too!) and freshly cooks typical breakfast every morning, giving the hotel a cosy and informal touch.

In my case I am vegan, so they gave me avocado instead of eggs and always found a way to make sure I had a good breakfast. The showers are big, clean and by far the best pressure and heat I've experienced in Latin America. It is pet friendly and they have a beautiful dog who always greets you with lots of love. \nAlso they can organize tours or shuttles for your next destination, at reasonable prices and that pick you up from the hostel.

Then the guy who gave me the keys and wanted the cash, did not want to give me a receipt or show me his ID.  He backed down when I started to roll my suitcase back out the door.  Then I got an e-mail three days after I checked in, informing me that alcohol was prohibited on the property.  Then someone, obviously someone with a key, stole 1000 quetzales out of my apartment.  The owner threatened me with legal action if I reported it to the cops, because \"I couldn't prove it\" and \"nobody has keys.\"  I went to the market with the keys and asked if I could get five copies made.  \"Of course!  No problem!\"  So any prior guest or employee could have keys.  Duh.  What a jerk!  Also the apartment is extremely dark, can't possibly read in there at night.  And, your cell phone won't work in the apartment, although they certainly don't tell you that.\rOh, and apparently the genesis of the e-mail about alcohol was that on Saturday night I had a loud, drunk woman in my apartment making a lot of noise.  Actually, I was out all evening and went directly to bed, alone, when I got home at midnight.  So there is some neighborhood witch who likes to complain but has a bad sense of directional hearing.

The female receptionist did end up making the breakfast, and she was lovely and nice.  I have been traveling and living in mostly hostels for 3 years, and this was the worst experience I have ever had in a hostel.  I am not a fussy traveler, If you show me what I am really getting, I am generally pretty happy. Don't put that you speak english when the receptionist doesn't, receptionist should be polite and friendly even in difficult situations, toilet paper is (in my opinion) the bare minimum of hospitality.

Was told i would have to pay extra for the additional child.\nLater on that day i asked for some drinking water at 8.30 pm was told that the kitchen was now closes so i would have to purchase it at 4 times the local price. \nWas told breakfast was from 7-10 asked for breakfast at 7 one morning as we had an activity to start at 8 was told I couldn't get breakfast till 8.\nConsidering the hotel was empty I had no feedback on laundry services and asked to meet with the manager who never bothered to approach me about my complaint. \nIn the end I just paid my bill without looking at it as it would have enraged me. Was glad I only booked 2 nights here as the hotel round the corner did me a room for 5 people with free teas coffees and water Hotel Camelieas Inn at half the price for a much more scenic room and roof terrace \nMedusa", "score": "5", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Family with young children", "Triple Room with Private Bathroom", "Stayed 2 nights", "Submitted from a mobile device"]}

In Antigua, this is quite a distance, as it's a really challenging city to get your bearings in. It's mostly a grid but very few streets are actually labeled/signed.\rThe breakfast was adequate at best. Not sure if the menu changed, but it's certainly nothing to look forward to. The free airport pick-up (a promotion mentioned on TripAdvisor) turned out not to be free, and when my flight time changed by 2 hours (which I communicated the day before arriving), I was left to get a cab at the airport. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid and the free shuttle promotion was the reason I booked this place. Really lame.\rCandelaria also seems to cater to loud groups of teenage tour groups, which got old.\rOn top of all this, I opted to stay in Antigua for an extra day due to some medical stuff that came up. Switching hotels was too big of a pain, so I extended by a day and moved from the Special Room to the Standard Room, unable to justify $87/night for a pretty basic room. Bad move.

It was an old, faded, small peice of cloth- women were selling similar brand new ones for \u00a32 on the street, but my husband didnt know that and just agreed to pay the \u00a310 for it. We later had it washed with our own laundry and the ink came right out, so he obviously lied about having it cleaned!

The girl said to me: ask to that guest that is near the storage. I went to him and he also didn't have it, but he also double checked on his pants, one pair of pants that were inside of his backpack. But then he reminded that another guy, a guest, had the guest after him.\nNo signal of this guy. For more than 10 minutes they were searching for the keys!\nCOME ON! They found the key and I started to check my stuff, the thing is that I have a really good locker for the backpack. I started to say to the guy that they should be more careful with this situation. The guy answer me: so, why you put your staff on the storage?\nAs I couldn't do the check in, prior the 3pm, is impossible.

I turned myself and clapped my hands while saying: well done, you guys are doing a really good job! They reaction were like: no, she had another night booked for today.

After my stay and time to reflect on my experience, overall I'd say expectations were not met:\r1) While the overall aesthetic was well done, the lack of noise isolation from other rooms and the outside made the stay in the room and sleep at night uncomfortable. We were placed in one of the first/ground floor rooms. Any movement and conversation held by our neighbors directly above us was heard quite vividly, almost amplified given the construction of the house.\r2) The shower drain was clogged and therefore did not drain properly. It appeared to have been clogged for sometime as I felt a layer of film/residue that coated the shower floor. The shower itself worked fine, but this made for an unpleasant shower.\r3) Price for this house/hotel was high given my experience and also when compared to other places available in the area.\r4) The following was a small, but impactful experience during my stay. I had made the reservation at Casa Girasol for three nights. The morning after the second night, one of the staff members was trying to inform my guest and I that we were to check-out that morning. I called another staff member to sort the issue out. They informed me that I was not checking-out, but I needed to move rooms as another guest (arriving that night) had requested the room I was placed in. It was eventually decided that I'd stay in the existing room, but the fact that the staff would even request that of my guest and I seemed rather unprofessional. I believe it is the property manager's responsibility to prevent those conflicts from occurring, and not my responsibility to accommodate another guest, let alone a guest who had not even arrived at the property.", "score": "6.7", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Couple", "Deluxe Room", "Stayed 3 nights"]}

Fine I guess; I suppose I'm just particular in that I like to have someone around in case I need anything during my stay.\rRoom - My room was the first one on the ground floor. The way the hotel is built, all other guests have to walk past this room's window, so I tended to keep the curtains closed for privacy. The other window looks out into a small outdoor utility space (= nothing to see), directly across from which is the kitchen window - so again, I tended to keep the blind closed.

The bathroom had a glass block style window as did the closet both of which weren't openable. There was no curtain on the store room window either so it was impossible to have a fully dark room which I prefer. The guests in this room need to be able to access the window downstairs to be able to open it. Secondly the Casa is clearly set up on more of an AirBnB, full house rental basis, which would work well. They're not set up for the comings and goings of a normal guest house though. It was quite an ordeal just to get someone to come so I could pay them which was time-consuming and frustrating both for me and probably the owner.

There are shutters and curtains, which keep the room very dark at night, making it easy to sleep.  Security is excellent, with a gated interior and doors that lock in the evening.  A night watchman let me in when the doors were closed.  Marco, Oscar, and the new young assistant were welcoming from the moment I checked in till the moment I checked out.

It has several nice seating areas that are nicely decorated and comfortable. The furnishings and decor around the courtyard are done extremely well which add charm to the hotel. This is our second stay at the hotel and both rooms have been very comfortable and beautifly decorated. Breakfast also comes with the room which is a plus.", "negative_content": "What could have been better you ask? Several things on this visit I have comments about. This trip for breakfast, Oscar was not there as the waiter either day of our stay and the cook was doing double duty which slowed things down for the service. We like our coffee hot with our breakfast and both days on this stay, the coffee was tepid at best. An other thing that I have a comment about is the shower. The water control for the showers is the type that you turn on full blast and then turn left or right to control how warm you want it. The problem with this is that the water is coming out of the shower head Full blast and you have no way to control the pressure of the water which I personally do not care for and I think is a large waste of water. Our first stay at this hotel, the room had a larger shower but this room had a small shower which I had to turn the water off in order to soap up my body because there was no place to move to in order to get out of the way of the blast of water from the shower head. The hotel should consider switching out the shower controls in these eight rooms in order to conserve the precious water supply in Antigua and to give their hotel guests a more pleasant shower experience. Lastly, the internet connection for this trip kept going out. The front desk said that the area around the hotel was having internet problems and each time I asked, he reset the router and the internet came back promptly.", "score": "9.6", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Couple", "Superior Room, 1 King Bed", "Stayed 2 nights", "Submitted from a mobile device"]}

The majority are priced at 50 Quetzales with some at 70, and we were told we could have any as they were included in our rate. We ordered two at 50 and then wanted an extra portion of fruit; illogically we were told we would have to pay an extra 10 even though we were still within the maximum. This was unacceptable and the owner was most unpleasant about it, only very reluctantly agreeing to a free exra portion.  Believe it or not, he even said that if we did not like the way he ran the breakfast we could leave. We felt upset by his behaviour; he clearly has no idea of hospitality. \r3) We had Room 5 which was quite a good room in many ways but there was some traffic noise (although not as bad as some rooms facing the main road).

The bathroom had a huge shower with two rainshower head fixtures and lovely tile. The beds had quality linens and mattresses. I slept better than I had in weeks!\rBreakfast is included in the price and you can eat in the dining room, patio, or on the rooftop terrace -- and it's delicious with a choice of eggs, pancakes, granola, and so on. We also ate dinner at the hotel two nights and enjoyed the food. My teenage daughter got a creamy pasta she liked (and she's kind of picky) and I had a tasty black bean soup and tomato mozzarella salad (I knew the kitchen would be careful with cleaning and preparing food for North American stomachs).\rI really liked the location of the hotel as well. It is easy walking distance to the Parque Central (about 10 minutes away) but in a quieter part of the downtown. I felt totally safe walking around the area during the day (we stayed in at night so I can't comment on that, but in general Antigua is quite safe though you need to use common sense and it's best to walk with others at night).\rWhoever worked on the design of the interiors deserves an award.
