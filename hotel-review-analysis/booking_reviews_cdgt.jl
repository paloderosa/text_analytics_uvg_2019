Great!

Again may I stress that we had no problem waiting for a room in the first place.\rWe waited by the pool and decided to order drinks from the bar and a snack.  The service was terrible, the young man didn\u2019t know his job and it took us half an hour to receive a drink from when we ordered.  I asked for ginger ale, which would as on the menu but was informed that they didn\u2019t have any.  I decided to go to the bar and investigate, to my shock he was currently serving a ginger ale to another customer! May I add that there was no language barrier here as I speak fluent Spanish.\rWe checked in after 3pm and were given a room with a balcony (a cheaper option) when we paid for a larger room.  At this point we didn\u2019t care to discuss this with Astrid (who also happened to be the weekend supervisor!) and decided to wait until Monday.\rWhen we spoke to the reception manager on Monday, she duly apologized and we were moved rooms again. This whole fiasco along with repeated problems with service throughout the hotel made for an unpleasant experience.\rIf you are a 5 star upmarket hotel then start by training your staff accordingly.\rFor the money we paid I wasn\u2019t worth it and we wouldn\u2019t bother staying again.

I had to ask three times if we could please be helped until she figured out she could maybe call a colleague. After finally checking in we went to the bar to relax something and get a drink. What we didn't expect was that the bar wasn't your typical hotel lobby but a really loud disco full of trashy people who went to a conference across the hotel. Besides the fact that we cannot believe anyone would prefer a loud disco over a nice relaxed lobby while in such an hotel, the worst part was that we could only sit down if we spend 75 quetzales or more. I'm a guest at your hotel but I can't sit down to drink something unless I promise to spend a lot of money?? Super weird. Lastly there was an alarm clock in our room which was set to a time by I guess the previous guest which made us wake up at 00:30 while we had to catch a flight at 04:00. Super incovenient and in such a place this really should not have happened. Really this hotel is more like a trashy nightclub than a luxury hotel and I would never recommend this place.

The first time we were able to get accommodated with a ground floor room as both times I have stayed with my mom and grandmother both with knee injury so for them is very difficult the use of stairs. This time around the front desk guy said they were sold out so we were given an upstairs room which was smaller than the first time one. Restroom was narrow and toilet too close to the sink and the staircase made it difficult to fit 2 people next to each other which didnt allowed me to assist my grandmother when heading to and from the room. There was no stair rail the first bottom stairs which I didnt appreciate and was a safety concern. They are definitely not ADA friendly as there is no elevator neither. I just wished to know that when I booked on booking.com but know to request or at least to call ahead before booking. Ill definitely stay here every time I visit Guatemala but wont consider if they dont have more accesible rooms available.

The place is less than 1km from the airport so no airport shuttle would go there. However there are earnings not to walk the distance as the risk of getting robbed on the way is too high. If you grab a cab, it costs 10 dollars (for less than 1km...).\nThe problems started when I first communicated with the hostel to request their  service. The replied quite abruptly and in Spanish and said they will only drive out once I'm out of the airport and waiting by the exit. Tough luck if your mobile has no reception in Guatemala. I called them when I arrived, a man who couldn't speak English answered. Then a woman who spoke little English. I told her I was waiting by the exit and that I wear a big orange Rucksack. I waited 45 minutes and nobody showed up. I had to take one of the 10 dollar cabs to get me to my destination.\nAt the hostal, I rang the bell and it took them a while to open. Straight away a man started insulting me I Spanish, upset that I was ringing the bell too much and that his wife had waited at the airport for ages and I didn't show up. To be clear, this is a tiny aiport and it's beyond me how she didn't spot me. I don't think she even left the car. She had my number but wasn't bothered calling. I had to pay my bill immediately and without further shown around, I was escorted to my room. Escorting is the only way I can put it as next I discovered I was staying in what resembled a prison cell. No windows! I couldn't believe I was paying 30 dollars per night for a room with no windows.\nBut that wasn't all.

They can organize transportation for you but there is a huge roundabout 2 minutes away from the hostel and it's super easy to catch a taxi.

I was told to grab a taxi that cost $10 from the airport to the hotel.

When I explained that it was included as a hotel courtesy and hotel staff checked my reservation: she agreed with me-shuttle service was included. This is before my departure from the USA.\n2. I was asked to emailed a copy of my boarding ticket to check fly #, airline company, and arrival time and to coordinate with shuttle. I emailed the requested information assuming everything should be fine. A) Hotel did not send shuttle to pick me up. Instead, hotel staff sent a taxi to pick me up which arrive an hour late; several calls were made to the hotel and staff was unable to dispatch the shuttle or another taxi. So I had to wait an hour for the taxi to arrive. Finally, the taxi arrived and took me to the hotel. Upon arrival, the taxi driver was expecting me to pay him Q150 quetzales for his services; and I told him that I thought the service was courtesy of the hotel. MISCOMMUNICATION AGAIN. Proceeded to go to the front desk and spoke with someone about this misunderstanding. The woman who was behind the front desk was very courteous and attentive during this time. For example, she did not know the shuttle was supposed to go to the airport and pick me up, did not know that I did not have to pay for the taxi. And she did not know that I had requested originally an internal room not one with balcony and facing the street (Room 218) because the windows are not sound proof and they easily rattle with traffic or gusts. AGAIN MISCOMMUNICATION.

When I explained that it was included as a hotel courtesy and hotel staff checked my reservation: she agreed with me-shuttle service was included. This is before my departure from the USA.\n2. I was asked to emailed a copy of my boarding ticket to check fly #, airline company, and arrival time and to coordinate with shuttle. I emailed the requested information assuming everything should be fine. A) Hotel did not send shuttle to pick me up. Instead, hotel staff sent a taxi to pick me up which arrive an hour late; several calls were made to the hotel and staff was unable to dispatch the shuttle or another taxi. So I had to wait an hour for the taxi to arrive. Finally, the taxi arrived and took me to the hotel. Upon arrival, the taxi driver was expecting me to pay him Q150 quetzales for his services; and I told him that I thought the service was courtesy of the hotel. MISCOMMUNICATION AGAIN. Proceeded to go to the front desk and spoke with someone about this misunderstanding. The woman who was behind the front desk was very courteous and attentive during this time. For example, she did not know the shuttle was supposed to go to the airport and pick me up, did not know that I did not have to pay for the taxi. And she did not know that I had requested originally an internal room not one with balcony and facing the street (Room 218) because the windows are not sound proof and they easily rattle with traffic or gusts. AGAIN MISCOMMUNICATION.

I didn't have anything like that, so instead of accepting money, he said I could have the book for free and to just bring another book I don't want anymore the next time I stay there. I thought that was so cool because they could have easily said \"Well, that book will be Q50\" or something, but instead they just wanted to be nice. They were quite generous overall, giving away free trinkets at the front desk (like earplugs, though we didn't need them.) They let us use their phone when ours wouldn't work.

Restroom was narrow and toilet too close to the sink and the staircase made it difficult to fit 2 people next to each other which didnt allowed me to assist my grandmother when heading to and from the room. There was no stair rail the first bottom stairs which I didnt appreciate and was a safety concern. They are definitely not ADA friendly as there is no elevator neither.

There are people walking around (even in the parking garage) spraying perfume to override the smell. I seriously wonder if the sewage smell is a health risk.", "negative_content": "Secondly, it would be nice for there to be spots indicated for guests of the hotel in the parking deck- especially so you know where the best area is to get up to the hotel easily. My husband had to leave for a trip one night that I was at the hotel and he accidently took our parking garage ticket- although the front desk had a stack full of them, they first acted like there was no way they could help me and that my car would be stuck until my husband returned. I even asked for the manager and in the end she very rudely announced she would \"let\" me pay a $50 deposit to get my car out of the garage. She was clearly not service oriented or trained to recognize that the guests are the ones paying her salary- her whole attitude was very inappropriate and I am surprised Hyatt has kept her around. When I trained to get her name she twisted her name tag and hid it from me. We stayed 3 nights but at the end decided we would love to stay another night and they said we would have to switch rooms and the rate would be $50 more. It seems that if someone has been staying in your hotel, you would want them to stay longer and offer them the same rate. The room service was nice and I knew it came with a tip and a delivery fee, but in addition to this, they tried to sneak in another $8. I refused to sign and they fixed it later. There is no official bathroom door for some of the rooms so there was no where private to  change other than toilet area. At breakfast they make you sign something saying what it costs (even though it's free)- and they always wait until you are walking to the elevators- typically with an included breakfast they just ask for your room number upon arrival at breakfast. The servers at breakfast take forever to bring you coffee. When we asked for water, they brought us a bottle and tried to charge us for it. Of course we didn't pay because we simply asked for water and previous mornings they brought us something included with the breakfast.", "score": "6.7", "tags": ["Leisure trip", "Couple", "King Room", "Stayed 3 nights"]}
